            <h2>Recursively Implementing Breadth First Search Functionally</h2>
            <p>Breadth First Search is an algorithm for searching through a graph one level at a time. My friend told me that it is impossible to do recursively, and so obviously I had to give it a try! Usually BFS is implemented interatively. This is a recursive implementation of BFS in a Scheme dialect known as Racket.</p>

            <h2>Vectorizing Forward/Back Propogation for Neural Networks</h2>
            <p>There's a machine learning on coursera that I've been actively following, and in a recent lecture, the professor, Andrew Ng, explained how to implement the backpropogation algorithm. His implementation involved a for-loop going through all the data one at a time. He never actually taught how to do it with pure vectors, so I derived it. Check out how!</p>

            <h2>The Power of Bits!</h2>
            <p> Learn about using bit vectors to solve problems with increased efficiency. The other day my friend challenged me to solve a certain problem in O(n) time, and so of course I took it.</p>

        <p> My final and successful attempt to solve the knights tour. This time, by inventing my own data structure!</p>

            <h2>Knight's Tour Try 3: Graphs</h2>
        <p> Graphs, I had to learn these so I implemented these too. Still not quite working.</p>

            <h2>Knight's Tour Try 2: Binary Search Trees</h2>
        <p> Trying again with binary search trees, figured may as well implement them after learning them.</p>

        <p> Trying to solve the knight's tour using lists as my main data structure. Works for some, not all!</p>
